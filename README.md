# Credit-card-Fraud-detection-DL
This project is based on The Deep Learning model to detect the Credit Card fraud done by European cardholders in september 2013. We will learn Deep Learning concepts such as Artification Neural Networks,Layers,Activation Functions,Neurons. and top of that we will build Deep Learning Algorithm which mimics humain br ain We analyse data to get meaning information from them and Visualize them to recognise different patterns among them and showing meaning full information It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

# Overview of project:
In this Project,we deep dive into following areas -
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Balancing -Undersampling/Oversampling
4. Neural Network - Deep Learning technique
5. Evaluation of Model

# Data set Details:
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
